Both look and my-look ON unix systems take a string as input and return any lines in a file that contain that string as a prefix. 

Example:
prompt> ./my-look -f /usr/share/dict/words gn

GNU
GNU's
Gnostic
Gnostic's
Gnosticism
Gnosticism's

my-look reads the file /usr/share/dict/words and prints out all the lines that start with the letters "gn".
